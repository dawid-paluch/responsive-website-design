    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
        This is all of the work experiences I've had so far and a general description for what the responsiblities that I had, were for each of these roles.

      <h2>Assistant Tutor</h2>
      <p class="experienceDate">September 2022 - today</p>
      <p class="experiencePlace">Kumon Clapham Common
      <p>
        I would work for Kumon to assist with the tutoring of children that clients of the company would bring to be aided with. This would be in either Maths or English depending on what it was that the 
        given client request for the child to be aided with. This was my first time being part of a work enviroment and it was a very interesting experience that I quickly got used to. Through this I was
        able to gain further skills to not only improve my ability to tutor privately, as I could see how an established company would do it, but also it allowed me to better understand where people often
        make mistakes or have misunderstandings and this knowledge helped me develop my own method for study as well as general approach to various things in life.

      <h2>Private Tutor</h2>
      <p class="experienceDate">June 2022 - today</p>
      <p class="experiencePlace">n/a
      <p>
        I would work with individuals requiring aid with their studies who would generally be between 12 and 16 years old, however there were a few people that were younger. I would work with them for various 
        time periods depending on each personâ€™s needs and to help them understand any of their lacking knowledge. Most of my tutees would be in the subject of maths however I did also tutor a few people in 
        english and science. Through this I was able to learn how to better interact with people in a helpful and positive manner.

      <h2>Mentor for Younger Students</h2>
      <p class="experienceDate">September 2021 - June 2022</p>
      <p class="experiencePlace">Bieshop Thomas Grant Secondary School
      <p>
        During my time at school, I had also participated within a mentorship program. This would be where older students would provide personal meeting with certain younger students that were selected due to
        issues they were having. These meeting would take place on a weekly basis and I would try to help the given student with my advice and aid. This would range from things such as general things that could 
        be affecting them to things such as specific academic help.
